[Typey Type](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/) is a free typing app designed for steno students to practise and master stenography.

User progress is stored as a json object containing each word typed along with the number of times the user has typed it without making a misstake. This simple html-file allow users to paste their progress and be presented by a sorted list of each word, colored in a gradient from green to red to visualize progress in a simple format.
